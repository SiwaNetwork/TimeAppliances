  # If there are multiple layer stackups in the design and LAYER_STACKUP_NAME field
  # is specified, the layers for each of the layer stackups will be exported, so there
  # is one record in the output for each layer used in each layer stackup.  The stackup
  # name will be given as the LAYER_STACKUP_NAME field value to indicate which stackup
  # that layer has been listed for.
  # LAYER_SORT will show the stackups in stackup order, which is the order from left
  # to right that they are shown in the Cross-section Editor.  Within each
  # stackup's set of layer records, the individual layers will be shown in layer cross-
  # section order.

  # Warning: If there are multiple layer stackups in the design, then unless
  # LAYER_STACKUP_NAME field is specified, only the Primary stackup layers will be exported
